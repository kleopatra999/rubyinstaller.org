## Ruby 2.1.3

This new version of Ruby also brings new changes to RubyInstaller.

Similar to 2.0.0, the packages will be provided in two versions:
32bits (x86) and 64bits (x64).

This is possible thanks to newer compiler provided by mingw-w64 project.

Same DevKit used for version 2.0.0 is required for this version.

### Important information

Please note that the installers in this release are *not digitally signed*.

You can read more about this in post at RubyInstaller group:
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyinstaller/NhAqcepQ-Xw/discussion

#### Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you
understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this
version.

It is our recommendation you use 32bits until these issues are solved.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there
is no performance issue around it.

#### Ruby 2.1.x is brand new

While officially 2.1.x is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will
magically work on it.

Use 2.1.3 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works
properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.

#### Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.0 compatible

Ruby 2.1 introduces ABI breakage which means compiled C extensions with previous
1.9.3 or 2.0.0 will not run against Ruby 2.1.

**DO NOT install Ruby 2.1 on top of existing Ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0.0**, or try to
use compiled extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

```
gem install <name> --platform=ruby
```

This **will require you have the extra dependencies installed** for that gem to
compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.

#### Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of another version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in
compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and
'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

* Download and install `DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2` for 32bits Ruby
* Download and install `DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2` for 64bits Ruby

### Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
`config.yml` for it to work. See the following issues for details:
